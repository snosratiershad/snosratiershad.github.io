writenow is a opensource command-line clone of [Ensō](https://enso.sonnet.io/) I first saw Ensō two years ago in HN and was very interested in the idea. I wanted an opensource version of it installed on my machine. So, I tried to clone it using bash script as a command-line version, you can find [here](https://github.com/snosratiershad/writenow/).

The project hasn't been maintained for few months as I got busy on my 9to5 job. 
However, I’ve dedicated time for open-source contributions starting in 2025, and one of my current goals is to further develop writenow.

My next steps are to create a to-do list of future tasks and work on them in short-term iterations.

All issues, PRs, and feedback are welcome, and I’d be delighted if you starred the repository on GitHub.
