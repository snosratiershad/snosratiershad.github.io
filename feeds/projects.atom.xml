&lt;p&gt;The project hasn't been maintained for few months as I got busy on my 9to5 job. 
However, I’ve dedicated time for open-source contributions starting in 2025, and one of my current goals is to further develop writenow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next steps are to create a to-do list of future tasks and work on them in short-term iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All issues, PRs, and feedback are welcome, and I’d be delighted if you starred the repository on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Projects"></category></entry></feed>
